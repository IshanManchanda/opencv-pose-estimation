# AGV Task 5: Pose Estimation

### Project Structure

main.py is the entry-point into the project, 
which calls calibration.py to compute the intrinsic parameters.
The input images are present in the data directory while
the generated images are stored in the out directory.

A small take_img.py helper script was used to conveniently take images
from the webcam.
